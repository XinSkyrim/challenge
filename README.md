# Pixelforce Flutter Challenge

This project is my submission for the Pixelforce Flutter Challenge.
It is a Flutter application created to demonstrate basic Flutter development, project setup, and page navigation.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to build a simple Flutter application within a limited time frame.
The project focuses on demonstrating a working Flutter setup, basic UI pages, and navigation flow.

This project is not intended to be a fully completed product.

## Environment Requirements

- Flutter SDK installed
- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
- Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins enabled
  (or any IDE that supports Flutter development)

## Setup & Run

After configuring Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio, run the following commands in the project root directory:

flutter pub get  
flutter run

The application can be run on:
- The web (Flutter Web, e.g. Chrome)
- A physical Android device

## Current Implementation

At the current stage, the application includes the following pages:
- Explore
- Chat
- Profile

These pages are implemented to demonstrate basic UI structure and navigation.

## Challenge & Limitations

Due to limited time, the user login functionality was not fully completed.
A bug was encountered during the implementation of the login process, and this part of the application remains unfinished.

Authentication-related features are not included in the current demo.

## Next Steps

The next planned improvement is to fix and complete the user login process, including the authentication flow.
